# Code Quiz

### Do you have what it takes to be a web developer?

This is my fourth challenge assignment for the University of Oregon Coding Bootcamp 2022. The challenge is to create an application using JavaScript and Web APIs that will give a timed code quiz to the user, removing time off the clock if a question is answered incorrectly.

## Usage and Features

This is how the main page appears to users. The page is responsive, adapting to multiple screen sizes.

## Suggestion Box

In the future, I would like to add the following improvements:

- Add a page that displays what the user answered vs the correct answers for each question. 
- Add a functionality that allows users to add their own questions. 
- Add a functionality that randomizes the question order.

I'm a big believer in always refactoring code to improve it's functionality. If you would like to suggest your own improvements, you can reach me at the following links.
