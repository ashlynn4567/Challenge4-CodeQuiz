# Code Quiz

### Do you have what it takes to be a web developer?

This application was created as a resource to students studying computer programming. Once launched, it navigates the user through a visually appealing coding quiz. It asks multiple choice questions about JavaScript, recording correct or incorrect answers and notifying the user if their choice was correct. This quiz includes a timer which counts down once the user starts the quiz. The timer decreases by ten questions for each incorrect response. Once the timer reaches zero, the quiz ends. 

While building this project, I learned how to use JavaScript through Web APIs - such as localStorage and DOM. These tools allowed me to select elements on the page and dynamically create or remove elements as needed. This dynamic behavior allowed me great flexibility in showing the user what I wanted to, without the need for mulitple HTML pages. 

The greatest challenge I faced in this project was in using the localStorage Web API. I had to figure out how to store the user's current score and input (from where they enter their initials) within localStorage, as well as how to access it from storage when displaying the high score screen. I found success in storing the information as a string using `JSON.stringify`, then converting it back into its normal data type upon retrieving the information. 

## Usage and Features

This is how the main page appears to users. The page is responsive, adapting to multiple screen sizes.

## Suggestion Box

In the future, I would like to add the following improvements:

- Add a page that displays what the user answered vs the correct answers for each question. 
- Add a functionality that allows users to add their own questions. 
- Add a functionality that randomizes the question order.

I'm a big believer in always refactoring code to improve it's functionality. If you would like to suggest your own improvements, you can reach me at the following links.
